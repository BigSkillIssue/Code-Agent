# Progress

Next step: S02

## Done
| Step | Date | Commit | Files | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S01 | 2026-10-05 | (next) | pyproject.toml, src/forge/__init__.py, src/forge/__main__.py, src/forge/cli.py, tests/test_smoke.py, .github/workflows/ci.yml, PROGRESS.md, .gitignore, .python-version | `forge --version` prints `forge 0.1.0`; CI matrix ubuntu/macos/windows runs the gate |

## Decisions
- Session: the user asked for all steps to be built in one go, without stopping between steps, directly on `main`. This overrides "one step per session" (user instruction > AGENTS.md); every step still gets its own tests, gate run, PROGRESS.md entry and commit.
- S01: the Commit column is filled in by the following step's commit (a commit cannot contain its own hash).
- S01: build backend is hatchling; `.python-version` pins 3.12 for local work, matching CI.
- S01: ruff excludes `*.md`, because ruff 0.16 also formats Python blocks inside Markdown and would rewrite the binding contracts in `docs/`.
- S01: CI uses `concurrency` with `cancel-in-progress` so a quick series of pushes runs CI only once.

## Open issues
- None yet.
